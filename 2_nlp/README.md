# Notebook for the NLP tutorial at M2L 2022

**Authors**: **[Giuseppe Attanasio](https://federicobianchi.io)** and **[Moreno La Quatra](https://mlaquatra.me/)**.

The tutorial is inspired to established walkthrough on the Transformer architecture: [1](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer) and [2](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/JAX/tutorial6/Transformers_and_MHAttention.html#The-Transformer-architecture).


### Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn the fundamental components of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines. 

Specifically, you will implement the Transformer architecture and test it on the *language modeling* and *machine translation* tasks. Along the way, you will learn core concepts such as self-attention, text tokenization, and more.

### Outline

The tutorial is structured as follows:

1. Introduction to the Transformer Architecture and its building blocks
2. Implementing the Core Components: Scaled and Multi-headed Attention, Embeddings, and Positional Encoding
3. Transformer Encoder and Word-Level Language Modeling
4. Fine-Tuning your Language Model for Sentiment Analysis
4. Transformer Decoder and Machine Translation 
5. *Bonus*: Gender Bias in MT

In each section, we will give you additional pointers to dive deeper on the specific topic. Just keep an eye to the üìö emoji.

### Libraries and Frameworks

You will use [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) for low level operations and [haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku) to model neural network modules, and [optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax) for training optimization. In addition, we will use [datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) and [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) for the data preparation utilities. 

### üìù Exercises

The sections marked as \[EXERCISE üìù\] contain cells with missing code that you should complete.
